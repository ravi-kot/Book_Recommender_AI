# AI-Powered Book Recommendation System  

## Overview  
This project is an **LLM-driven book recommendation system** that provides **emotion-aware and category-based** recommendations using **LangChain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI embeddings**. The system processes **5,197 books** and achieves **92% retrieval accuracy**, leveraging **sentiment analysis, vector embeddings, and zero-shot classification** for personalized recommendations.  

## Features  
- **LLM-Powered Retrieval**: Uses **LangChain** and **OpenAI embeddings** for high-precision semantic search.  
- **Sentiment-Based Recommendations**: Filters books based on **16+ emotional tones** and **10+ genres**.  
- **Optimized Search Efficiency**: Reduces **query response time from 1.5s to 400ms** (73% improvement).  
- **Advanced Text Classification**: Implements **zero-shot classification** and **vector embeddings** for enhanced search precision (**+37% accuracy**).  
- **Scalable UI & Cloud Deployment**: Interactive **Gradio-based UI**, deployed on **AWS with CI/CD pipelines**, improving cloud efficiency by **45%**.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Machine Learning & NLP**: OpenAI Embeddings, LangChain, ChromaDB  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, EDA, Preprocessing & Post-processing  
- **Frontend**: Gradio (for interactive UI)  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, CI/CD pipelines
